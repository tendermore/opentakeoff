// Counter-examples for symbol_sweep (#259, reported by @FrankAtGHub): "match
// these, but not those". Two mechanics, one gesture — the caller drags a box
// around the thing it does not mean and the rect's own contents decide which
// applies:
//
//   SHAPE — the lookalike carries EXTRA linework (the square around a flush
//   floor outlet, the letter inside a keynote triangle). Local evidence, so it
//   fingerprints like a positive.
//
//   CROSSING — the lookalike carries no extra contained linework; what marks
//   it is a line running THROUGH it. `fingerprintSymbol` admits fully-inside
//   segments only, so this is structurally inexpressible as a contained
//   fingerprint — background structure is long by nature. The reported case: a
//   2×4 fixture on a 2 ft ceiling grid, where two empty tiles reproduce the
//   fixture's outline exactly, and the only difference is that the empty tile
//   still has the grid line running through its middle while the real fixture,
//   drawn over the grid, breaks it.
//
// Both are synthetic reproductions of the reported cases, not the reported
// sheets. Every rejection must come back DISCLOSED: which negative, what it
// saw, and enough to reinstate it by hand.
