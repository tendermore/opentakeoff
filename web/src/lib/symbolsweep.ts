// Symbol Sweep — deterministic repeated-symbol matching (pure, no DOM;
// node-testable, the sheets.ts/oneclick.ts precedent).
//
// Plan symbols — drains, thresholds, fixtures, transition markers — are
// repeated vector blocks: the same little cluster of segments stamped across
// the sheet. Given ONE example instance (a marquee around it), find every
// other placement of that same cluster from the linework alone. No ML, no
// vision, no guessing: a placement either reproduces the seed's segments
// within a pixel tolerance or it doesn't, and the score says exactly how much
// of the seed it reproduced.
//
// The pipeline:
//   1. FINGERPRINT — the segments fully inside the seed rect, expressed
//      relative to their length-weighted centroid. Fully-inside, not
//      intersecting: a marquee around a drain must not drag in the wall run
//      passing behind it.
//   2. CANDIDATES — constellation anchoring. Sheets run 100k+ segments, so a
//      naive O(n·m) scan of every position is out. Instead, up to
//      ANCHOR_COUNT seed segments of DISTINCT quantized length (rarest
//      sheet-wide first — a rare length prunes hardest) each vote: every
//      sheet segment of matching length proposes the centroid the symbol
//      would have if that segment were this anchor, per symmetry transform.
//      Several anchors, deliberately: a placement stays discoverable even
//      when one of its segments is drawn perturbed (the near-miss case whose
//      whole point is to be REPORTED).
//   3. SCORE — for each candidate placement, each transformed seed segment
//      looks up a sheet segment whose endpoints both sit within tolPx (either
//      orientation) via an endpoint grid. Score = length-weighted fraction of
//      seed segments matched — a long wall-side matching counts more than a
//      tick mark.
//   4. CLASSIFY — score ≥ scoreHigh is a match; [scoreLow, scoreHigh) is a
//      WITHHELD near-match with a reason (a question the caller can answer
//      with a look, never a silent commit or a silent drop); below is not the
//      symbol. The seed's own location is reported separately and never
//      returned as a match.
//
// Symmetry: symbols rotate and flip on plans, so placements are searched
// under the square's symmetry group — 0/90/180/270 rotation × optional
// mirror — with both options ON by default and independently switchable.
//
// Work is CEILINGED and the ceiling is REPORTED: by default every proposed
// placement is scored (proposal enumeration is paid before the cap ever
// applied, so the cap only ever saved scoring time — #261 measured 19 of 62
// receptacles surviving a 20k cap that saved ~1 s), up to a hard ceiling for
// pathological sheets. `complete: false` plus candidates.dropped > 0 means
// some placements were never scored, and the caller is told rather than
// handed a silently truncated count (the sheet_context decimation doctrine).
//
// Phase 2 splits the pipeline at its natural seam: fingerprintSymbol (step 1)
// builds the centroid-relative fingerprint from ONE sheet's segments, and
// matchSymbol (steps 2–4) searches ANY sheet's segments for it — so a symbol
// marqueed on a detail or legend sheet can be counted across the plan sheets.
//
// Scale (#186). The fingerprint is size-true — translation plus the square
// symmetry group, no scaling — and the search stays that way: a scale SEARCH
// would trade exactness for guesses. But a detail sheet is drawn enlarged
// (1-1/2" = 1'-0" against a 1/8" plan is a 12× ratio), so a size-true search
// finds nothing there and, worse, finds it silently: no placement clears
// scoreLow, so zero matches with zero near-misses reads exactly like "that
// symbol isn't on these sheets." The fix is a STATED ratio, never a searched
// one — `opts.scale` is seed-sheet px per target-sheet px, which the caller
// computes from the two sheets' own committed scales (upp_seed / upp_target).
// One number, derived from data the estimator already stated. The endpoint
// test stays exactly as strict; tolerance rides the ratio only when the seed
// is being MAGNIFIED (its jitter magnifies with it), so scale ≤ 1 and the
// whole one-sheet surface are bit-for-bit unchanged.
//
// sweepSymbols composes the two on one sheet, unchanged.

// #259, reported by @FrankAtGHub, from counting a wall-mounted data outlet on
// an electrical set: the flush-floor variant of the same device is the SAME
// TRIANGLE inside a square, so it contains the wall symbol by drafting
// convention and matches on every sheet drawn that way. Asking drafting
// offices to stop reusing generic shapes is not a remedy — the matcher has to
// absorb the ambiguity.
//
// A negative is one more marquee: drag a box around the thing you do not mean.
// The caller never chooses a mechanism; the rect's own contents decide which
// of the two applies, because both are the same gesture to the person doing
// it.
//
//   SHAPE — the negative holds extra linework the positive does not (the
//   square around the flush outlet, the letter inside a keynote triangle).
//   The discriminator is local, so it fingerprints exactly like a positive.
//
//   CROSSING — the negative holds NO extra contained linework; what
//   distinguishes it is a line that passes THROUGH it. This mode exists
//   because `fingerprintSymbol` admits only segments FULLY INSIDE the rect,
//   which structurally excludes background structure — background structure
//   is long by nature. Frank's measured case: a 2×4 ceiling fixture on a 2 ft
//   grid, where two empty tiles reproduce the fixture's outline exactly. The
//   empty tile still has the grid line running through its middle at 337 px;
//   the real fixture, drawn over the grid, BREAKS it. A clean presence/absence
//   discriminator that no contained fingerprint can express.
//
// Both are expressed in the POSITIVE's canonical frame, so a rejection applies
// under every rotation and mirror the sweep searches.
