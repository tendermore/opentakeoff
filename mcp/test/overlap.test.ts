// This is the invariant `web/bench/run.mts`'s `pairwiseOverlapFrac` is reaching
// for and structurally cannot express: it compares a case's eight PINNED probes,
// so it can only see overlap between regions someone already thought to pin. It
// reports 0.000% on the sheet below while 16 SF of it is counted twice.
//
// What an estimator actually does is sweep with detect_rooms and then hand-click
// the spaces the sweep didn't name. So that is what this checks — every ring
// detect_rooms commits, plus hand clicks on the unnumbered spaces, run through
// an all-pairs intersection. A double-count is money: two regions that share
// floor put that floor in the bid twice, and neither reply says so.
//
// Deliberately NOT engine-self-referential: the overlap is measured off the
// returned vertex rings by point-in-polygon sampling, not by asking the engine
// whether it thinks it overlapped.
